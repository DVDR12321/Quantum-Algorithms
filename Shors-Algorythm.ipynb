    "Shor's algorithm is possibly the crown jewel of quantum computing so far. The goal of this algorithm is to find the prime factors of some large number $N$ and the key speedup this algorithm provides over the classical counterpart is by executing the period-finding part using a quantum computer. This has huge implications for cryptography and generally cyber-security.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Shor's algorithm is composed of the following steps:\n",
    "1. Choose a co-prime $a$, where $a\\in [2,N-1]$ and the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $N$ is 1.\n",
    "1. Find the order (periodicity) of $a$ modulo $N$, i.e. the smallest integer $r$ such that $a^r\\text{mod} N=1$\n",
    "1. Obtain the factor of $N$ by computing the greatest common divisor of $a^{r/2} \\pm 1$ and $N$."
